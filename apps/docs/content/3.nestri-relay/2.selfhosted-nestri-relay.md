## Self-hosted Nestri Relay

For those who prefer full control over their infrastructure, it is possible to self-host the Nestri Relay. However, setting this up can be a bit complex, as it requires generating SSL certificates for secure communication between your Nestri Node and your gaming devices. There are three main options:

- **Let's Encrypt Certificate**: This is the **recommended option** for self-hosting and requires a domain name. You can generate a certificate using tools like **certbot** or **acme.sh**. Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates that are trusted by most browsers and are relatively straightforward to set up.

- **Purchased SSL Certificate**: The **easiest option** for most users is to buy an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This option eliminates much of the hassle involved with certificate generation, as these certificates are already trusted by browsers and donâ€™t require as much manual setup.

While self-hosting offers more flexibility, most users will find the **Nestri-hosted Relay** to be the easiest and most reliable option for getting started with cloud gaming on Nestri. This hosted relay is available to everyone and requires no configuration.

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Requirements:**
   - Ensure **port 443** is open for both **TCP and UDP** (`:443/udp & :443/tcp`).
   - The server should have at least **4GB RAM** and **2 vCPUs**.
   - Supports both ARM or AMD64 architecture.

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - Docker and `docker-compose` must be installed on the server. You can use [this installation script](https://github.com/docker/docker-install) to set up Docker.
   - Git must be installed to clone the necessary repository.

3. **Certificates:**
   - You will need both private and public SSL certificates. It is recommended to use certificates from a **trusted Certificate Authority** (CA), either by using **Let's Encrypt** or purchasing a commercial SSL certificate, for secure communication. Avoid using self-signed certificates, as they can lead to compatibility issues and security warnings in browsers.
