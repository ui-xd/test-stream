# What is Nestri Relay?

Nestri Relay is an essential component in the Nestri cloud-gaming ecosystem, responsible for transporting the video gameplay stream from your Nestri Node to the device you’re playing on. It is built on the moq-rs protocol, designed for efficient and smooth video transmission, ensuring a low-latency gaming experience.

By default, your Nestri Node will connect to the Nestri-hosted Relay, which we manage and is available for all users. This is the simplest and most straightforward option, requiring no additional configuration on your end.
## ⚠️ Important Note

We recommend not installing Nestri Node on your primary PC if you only intend to use it over a weekend. This is because Nestri Node cannot run simultaneously with Xorg, the display server responsible for managing the graphical user interface (GUI). This means that while Nestri Node is running, you will not be able to use an attached screen. For this reason, Nestri Node is best set up on a dedicated machine that won’t be used for other tasks.
