# What is Nestri?

Nestri is a self-hosted cloud gaming platform that enables you to spin up dedicated gaming sessions remotely and play your own games from any device with a browser. Unlike remote desktop solutions like Parsec, which focus on streaming a desktop environment, Nestri is designed specifically for cloud gaming. It works similarly to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, allowing you to enjoy high-performance gaming without needing to be physically near your gaming PC.

The key difference with Nestri is that it’s entirely self-hosted, so you have full control over the server, the games you install, and the entire setup. Nestri is ideal for gamers who prioritize privacy, flexibility, and control, offering a way to manage your own gaming infrastructure rather than relying on third-party services. As long as you have a stable internet connection and access to a web browser, you can game from virtually anywhere.


## Nestri Modules

To provide a smooth and efficient gaming experience, Nestri is composed of the following key components:

### Nestri Node
The Nestri Node is the core of your Nestri setup. It acts as the game server where you install and run your games. The Nestri Node streams gameplay from the machine it’s installed on, allowing you to access your games remotely. It runs on most Linux-based systems and requires an NVIDIA graphics card to ensure a high-quality gaming experience.

Since Nestri Node cannot run alongside Xorg (the graphical interface), it’s recommended to install it on a dedicated machine. This way, your server can focus solely on streaming your games while avoiding conflicts with your local display setup.

### Nestri Relay
The Nestri Relay is responsible for transporting the video stream from your Nestri Node to the device you're gaming on. By default, Nestri connects to the Nestri-hosted Relay, which requires no configuration and is available for all users. This simplifies the setup process, ensuring a smooth streaming experience without the need for advanced networking or SSL certificate management.

For advanced users, it's possible to self-host the relay, but this requires the setup of secure SSL certificates. This option is typically more complex and is recommended only for developers or those familiar with network configuration.
