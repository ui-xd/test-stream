# FAQ


## Is Nestri free?
Yes! Nestri offers two options: a free, self-hosted version and a paid, hosted version.
- Self-Hosted Version (Free): If you have your own server, you can install and run Nestri for free. Since Nestri is open-source, you have full access to the codebase, allowing for transparency and flexibility in your setup.
- Hosted Version (Paid): The hosted version of Nestri operates similarly to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now. With a subscription, you can play your games on Nestri’s infrastructure without needing any technical knowledge—just sign up, log in, and start gaming!

## Does Nestri require a high-speed internet connection?
Yes, a stable and fast internet connection is essential for a smooth gaming experience. While you don’t need extremely high speeds (like 1 Gbps fiber), low latency is critical. Since cloud gaming is sensitive to delay, your device needs to connect to one of our relays with minimal lag. Ensuring a strong, stable network connection close to a relay server is important to avoid delays in gameplay, especially during fast-paced action sequences.

## Where are Nestri’s relays located?
Currently, we have one relay deployed in Helsinki, Finland. As we grow, we plan to add more relays to reduce latency and improve connection quality for users in different regions. Our next planned relay is in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since we’re a startup with a limited budget, we’ll continue to roll out more relays as demand grows and more users join the platform.

## Is Nestri like Parsec?
No, Nestri is not like Parsec, which is used to access and game on an existing desktop remotely. Nestri is a server application designed specifically for cloud gaming. Rather than connecting to a physical Windows desktop, Nestri runs your games within a Docker or Podman container, allowing you to play remotely without needing to access a traditional desktop environment.

## Do I need a high-end server with a 4090 GPU and a 64-core CPU?
Not necessarily! Nestri doesn’t have strict hardware requirements in terms of having the latest or most powerful CPU or GPU. Just as with traditional gaming, better hardware will enhance your experience with improved graphics and higher FPS. The exact specs you need will depend on the games you want to play and the performance you’re aiming for. Keep in mind that, because Nestri runs games on Linux using Proton and the Gstreamer encoding, there will be a bit of additional processing required, so some extra power will be helpful.
