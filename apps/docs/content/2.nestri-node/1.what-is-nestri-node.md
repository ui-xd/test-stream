# What is Nestri Node?

Nestri Node is the core component of Nestri's self-hosted cloud-gaming solution, designed for users who want the freedom and flexibility of running their own game-streaming server. Similar to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Nestri allows you to play your games remotely via your browser. However, unlike other cloud-gaming platforms, Nestri is fully self-hosted, giving you complete control over your server and gaming experience.

The Nestri Node is the actual server where you install your games. Once set up, you can stream and play your games remotely from any compatible device. It runs on machines with Linux and requires an NVIDIA, AMD or an Intel graphics card .
## ⚠️ Important Note

We recommend not installing Nestri Node on your primary PC if you only intend to use it over a weekend. This is because Nestri Node cannot run simultaneously with Xorg, the display server responsible for managing the graphical user interface (GUI). This means that while Nestri Node is running, you will not be able to use an attached screen. For this reason, Nestri Node is best set up on a dedicated machine that won’t be used for other tasks.
