 ## Can I run Nestri Node on Debian/Ubuntu? :icon{name="logos:ubuntu" style="opacity:100"} :icon{name="logos:debian" style="opacity:100"}
Unfortunately, it is not possible to run Nestri Node on Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu at this time. After extensive debugging efforts, we have decided to focus on platforms that currently work well, such as Fedora and Arch-based distributions. We may revisit the possibility of supporting Debian in the future, but for now, it is not supported.

## Can I run Nestri Node in a virtualized environment like Proxmox?
Yes, you can run Nestri Node in a virtualized environment, provided you passthrough your GPU to the virtual machine. However, we do not recommend this setup as virtualization may introduce additional overhead and latency. For the best performance, we recommend running Nestri Node on bare-metal hardware.

## Can I run Nestri Node on Windows-based systems?
No, the Nestri Node service does not support Windows-based systems. It can only be deployed on Linux servers.
