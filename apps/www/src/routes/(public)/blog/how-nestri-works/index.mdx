## Nestri

Nestri is an open-source, self-hosted GeforceNow alternative with more customization options and social features. This blog post aims to share what we've learned and how the system works.

## Welcome to Nestri!
At Nestri, we want to make gaming more accessible, literally.

## Key Features:
1. **Play Together**: Join a "party" and play co-op games with friends. You can even pass controls around to let others take a shot at your game.
2. **Save and Share Progress**: Share your game progress with a single link, just like sharing and embedding YouTube videos.
3. **One-Click Play**: Play games directly from your browser with a single click.
4. **Self-Hosted Deployment**: Deploy your own self-hosted GeforceNow system and play with friends on your own GPU.

## The Architecture

Nestri's architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing it to adapt based on user location and demand.

## The Frontend
This is the website, TV, and mobile apps (coming in the future). It provides the user interface for all Nestri features.

## Input System
Handles input and transmits it to the server, and sends force feedback from the server/game back to the player. We use Websockets on Cloudflare's Durable Objects with [Party Server](https://github.com/threepointone/partyserver) to send and receive input messages.

## Relay System
We use [Media Over Quic](https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport) to transmit audio and video from the server to the client. MoQ requires "relays"â€”servers that sit between the server and client for a pub-sub model. The server publishes to the relay, and the client/subscriber accesses the video/audio feed through namespaces.

## API/Nexus
The backbone of Nestri, tying everything together. It handles user queuing, server authorization, and more.

## Storage
Our database and storage system handles everything from caching to saving user data. We use S3-compatible storage for downloaded games. For the database, we use InstantDB for its simplicity, especially in authentication and multiplayer support.

## Admin Dashboard
We use Interval to programmatically create UIs for managing the entire system.

## Infrastructure
We've limited our infrastructure to Cloudflare and AWS for manageability. For self-hosted versions, you can use Cloudflare and your VPS.

## Games
We download games on behalf of the user from third-party stores like Epic Store, GOG Store, and Amazon Prime Gaming. Steam is challenging to implement due to the lack of third-party launchers.

## Game Servers
Games run on remote GPUs orchestrated by Nomad, which manages Nestri Docker containers. Containers are spun up or down based on demand.

## Mail
Handles communication, including login emails and marketing messages.
